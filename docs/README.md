# Introduction
In a general perspective, a file system also called filesystem or just fs, is the structure and logic norms used to manage groups of data. This system controls how data is stored and read, this way the different groups of information in a disk, drive or RAM have a determined location, size and name; and therefore they are usable for programs. Each of these groups of data is called a file.

There are different types of filesystems depending on their structure, logic, properties, security etc. They can be designed to work for a specific device, platform or application thus companies normally design their own to manage their files in a more optimised way. However, as we have seen there are numerous types and they can be used perfectly in a lot of cases.

Filesystems are present in different environments too, they are used in local data storage devices and through network protocols such as NFS (Network File System) developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984, SMB (Server Message Block) also known as Common Internet File System or 9P developed for the Plan 9 operating system that used UNIX concepts by Bell Labs in the 1980â€™s.

In this research we are focusing on virtual filesystems, which means that these systems work with virtual files when they are requested. The virtual filesystem manages the access to the content of a file and its metadata but is still responsible for using the enough storage space, being efficient and reliable to guarantee a proper management of the physical storage.
